  title: Why HPBHEX?
  description: >
    Because the HEX crypto project, founded by Richard Heart, is absolutely
    amazing, but we hate those damn Ethereum gas fees! We love the idea of Pulse
    and pHEX which will eliminate crazy gas fees, bu we don't know how long it
    will take to launch. So we thought to ourselves, why not re-run HEX, but on
    a layer 1 EVM chain that is CHEAP and is FAST right now?
description: "HPBHEX is HEX on steroids! - The underlying smart contract is
  pretty much identical, the main difference is that HPBHEX runs on HPB (High
  Performance Blockchain), a layer 1, decentralized, main-net, fully
  EVM-compatible blockchain, which runs FAST and runs CHEAP! When compared to
  Ethereum, it kinda feels like a no-brainer to run DApps there. For example,
  current average Ethereum gas fees are running at around $50. This is in
  comparison to HPB gas fees, which run at around $0.001 - Yep, less than one
  cent! Also Ethereum is slooooooooow - Average transactional speeds on Ethereum
  run at a snails-pace 25tps. This is in comparison to the lightning fast
  5000tps on HPB main-net. HPB is what Ethereum 2.0 hopes to be one day, but
  it's here, it's live and people are using it. "
